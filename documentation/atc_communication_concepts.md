## 1. ATC Hierarchy and Control Responsibilities

**ATC Control Hierarchy:**
1. **Ground Control**
   - Controls all movements on the ramp/apron
   - Manages pushback and taxiway movements
   - Handles gate assignments and ground vehicle movements
   - Frequency typically ends with "Ground" (e.g., "Boston Ground")

2. **Tower Control**
   - Controls all runway operations
   - Manages takeoffs and landings
   - Controls aircraft in the immediate airport vicinity
   - Frequency typically ends with "Tower" (e.g., "Boston Tower")

3. **Departure Control**
   - Manages aircraft after takeoff
   - Provides initial climb instructions
   - Handles aircraft until they reach cruising altitude
   - Frequency typically includes "Departure" (e.g., "Boston Departure")

4. **Approach Control**
   - Manages arriving aircraft
   - Provides descent and approach vectors
   - Coordinates with Tower for landing sequence
   - Frequency typically includes "Approach" (e.g., "Boston Approach")

## 2. ATC State Machine Concept

**State Machine Representation:**
```
[Ground] → [Tower] → [Departure] → [Center]
    ↓          ↓          ↓           ↓
[Wait]     [Wait]     [Wait]      [Wait]
```

**State Transitions and Waiting Points:**

1. **Ground → Tower Transition**
   - Wait Point: Holding short of runway
   - Trigger: Clearance to enter runway
   - Example: "Delta 123, hold short Runway 22L" → "Delta 123, line up and wait Runway 22L"

2. **Tower → Departure Transition**
   - Wait Point: Initial climb altitude
   - Trigger: Reaching specified altitude/point
   - Example: "Delta 123, climb and maintain 5,000" → "Delta 123, contact Departure 125.8"

3. **Departure → Center Transition**
   - Wait Point: Airspace boundary
   - Trigger: Reaching enroute altitude/airspace boundary
   - Example: "Delta 123, climb and maintain 10,000" → "Delta 123, contact Center 132.55"

**Waiting State Characteristics:**
1. **Ground Wait States**
   - At gate (waiting for pushback)
   - At taxiway intersection
   - Holding short of runway
   - At runway entry point

2. **Tower Wait States**
   - Line up and wait
   - In traffic pattern
   - Holding for landing clearance
   - After landing, waiting for taxi clearance

3. **Departure Wait States**
   - At initial climb altitude
   - At vector points
   - At airspace boundary
   - During altitude restrictions

4. **Center Wait States**
   - At cruise altitude
   - At waypoints
   - During route changes
   - At airspace boundaries

**State Machine Rules:**
1. Each state has specific responsibilities
2. Transitions require explicit clearance
3. Waiting states maintain current clearance
4. No movement between states without authorization
5. Each state has its own communication protocol
6. Controllers coordinate state transitions

### Transponder State Management

**Transponder States by ATC Facility:**
1. **Ground Control State**
   - Initial squawk assignment
   - Mode: ON or ALT
   - TCAS: STBY or OFF
   - Common codes: Assigned departure code

2. **Tower Control State**
   - Mode: ALT (for altitude reporting)
   - TCAS: TA/RA (if in busy airspace)
   - Code verification before takeoff
   - Monitoring for emergency codes

3. **Departure/Approach State**
   - Mode: ALT
   - TCAS: TA/RA
   - Code changes for approach sequence
   - Traffic conflict monitoring

4. **Center/Enroute State**
   - Mode: ALT
   - TCAS: TA/RA
   - Code changes for sector transitions
   - Long-range traffic monitoring

**Transponder State Transitions:**
1. **Ground → Tower**
   - Verify squawk code is correct
   - Set Mode C (ALT)
   - Activate TCAS if required
   - Monitor for emergency codes

2. **Tower → Departure**
   - Maintain Mode C
   - Ensure TCAS is active
   - Monitor for traffic alerts
   - Be prepared for code changes

3. **Departure → Center**
   - Maintain Mode C
   - Keep TCAS active
   - Expect code changes
   - Monitor for traffic

**Emergency State Handling:**
1. **Radio Failure (7600)**
   - Maintain last assigned code
   - Follow last received clearance
   - Monitor appropriate frequency
   - Land at nearest suitable airport

2. **Emergency (7700)**
   - Set emergency code
   - Declare emergency
   - Follow ATC instructions
   - Maintain communication

3. **Security (7500)**
   - Set security code
   - Maintain normal operations
   - Follow security procedures
   - Await further instructions

**Transponder Integration Rules:**
1. Each ATC state has specific transponder requirements
2. Transponder state changes require verification
3. Emergency codes override normal operations
4. TCAS operations must be coordinated with ATC
5. Code changes must be acknowledged
6. Mode changes must be appropriate for phase of flight

## 3. Handoff Procedures and Frequency Changes

**Standard Handoff Process:**

1. **Initiation by Current Controller**
   - Controller identifies aircraft ready for handoff
   - Provides new frequency and any transition instructions
   - Example: "Delta 123, contact Tower 118.7, expect Runway 22L"

2. **Pilot Acknowledgment**
   - Must read back frequency and any instructions
   - Example: "Contacting Tower 118.7, expect Runway 22L, Delta 123"

3. **Frequency Change**
   - Pilot switches to new frequency
   - Establishes contact with new controller
   - Example: "Boston Tower, Delta 123 with you, taxiing to Runway 22L"

4. **New Controller Acknowledgment**
   - Confirms contact and provides new instructions
   - Example: "Delta 123, Boston Tower, continue taxi to Runway 22L"

**Frequency Change Protocol:**
1. Wait for explicit instruction to change frequency
2. Read back the frequency and any associated instructions
3. Switch to new frequency
4. Establish contact with new controller
5. Maintain current clearance until new instructions received

**Common Handoff Scenarios:**

1. **Ground to Tower**
   - Trigger: Approaching runway entry point
   - Ground: "Delta 123, contact Tower 118.7"
   - Pilot: "Contacting Tower 118.7, Delta 123"
   - Pilot (on Tower freq): "Boston Tower, Delta 123 with you, holding short Runway 22L"

2. **Tower to Departure**
   - Trigger: After takeoff, reaching specified altitude
   - Tower: "Delta 123, contact Departure 125.8"
   - Pilot: "Contacting Departure 125.8, Delta 123"
   - Pilot (on Departure freq): "Boston Departure, Delta 123 with you, climbing through 2,000"

3. **Departure to Center**
   - Trigger: Reaching enroute altitude or airspace boundary
   - Departure: "Delta 123, contact Boston Center 132.55"
   - Pilot: "Contacting Boston Center 132.55, Delta 123"
   - Pilot (on Center freq): "Boston Center, Delta 123 with you, level at 10,000"

**Important Handoff Rules:**
- Never change frequency without explicit instruction
- Always read back frequency changes
- Include current position/altitude when checking in with new controller
- Maintain current clearance until new instructions received
- If no response from new controller, return to previous frequency
- Report any issues or concerns during handoff
