# Crew Communication Procedures and Responsibilities

## 1. Crew Roles and Responsibilities

### Pilot Flying (PF)
- Primary responsibility for aircraft control
- Handles:
  - Flight controls
  - Thrust management
  - Aircraft configuration
  - Navigation
  - Visual scanning
- Must acknowledge all clearances and instructions

### Pilot Monitoring (PM)
- Primary responsibility for communications
- Handles:
  - Radio communications
  - Checklist execution
  - Systems monitoring
  - Navigation monitoring
  - Clearance readback
- Must read back all clearances and instructions

## 2. Communication Protocol

### Standard Callouts
1. **Frequency Changes**
   - PM: "Contacting [Controller] on [Frequency]"
   - PF: "Go ahead"
   - PM: "[Controller], [Callsign] with you, [Position/Altitude]"

2. **Clearance Readback**
   - Controller: "[Callsign], [Clearance]"
   - PM: "[Clearance], [Callsign]"
   - PF: "Acknowledged"

3. **Handoff Procedures**
   - PM: "Switching to [Controller]"
   - PF: "Go ahead"
   - PM: "[Controller], [Callsign] with you, [Position/Altitude]"

### Communication Flow
```
Controller → PM → PF → PM → Controller
```

## 3. Frequency Management

### Radio Setup
- Primary radio: Active frequency
- Secondary radio: Next expected frequency
- Standby frequency: Emergency/backup

### Frequency Change Procedure
1. PM identifies need for frequency change
2. PM sets new frequency on standby
3. PM announces frequency change
4. PF acknowledges
5. PM switches frequencies
6. PM establishes contact with new controller

## 4. Checklist Integration

### Communication-Related Items
- Radio checks
- Frequency verification
- Clearance confirmation
- Handoff readiness

### Standard Callouts
- "Radios set"
- "Frequencies verified"
- "Clearance confirmed"
- "Ready for handoff"

## 5. Emergency Procedures

### Communication Priority
1. Aviate (PF)
2. Navigate (PF)
3. Communicate (PM)

### Emergency Callouts
- PM: "Emergency, emergency, emergency"
- PM: "[Callsign], declaring emergency"
- PM: "Nature of emergency: [Description]"
- PM: "Requesting [Assistance]"

## 6. Best Practices

### General Rules
- Always use standard phraseology
- Maintain sterile cockpit during critical phases
- Cross-verify all clearances
- Document significant communications
- Maintain situational awareness

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Switching frequencies without confirmation
- Missing readbacks
- Incomplete clearance understanding
- Poor frequency management
- Lack of cross-verification
